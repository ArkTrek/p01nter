# p01nter üé®
A simple yet powerful drawing application built with Python's `tkinter` library, enabling users to create and edit lines, curves, and other shapes. This application allows for dynamic drawing and modification of shapes, including changing line thickness, color, and background. It also includes features for saving and opening drawings in a custom format (`.ps` and `.json`), exporting the canvas as PNG images, and switching between light and dark modes.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Draw Lines and Curves**: Draw and edit lines with adjustable points to create curves.
- **Change Line Thickness**: Dynamically adjust the thickness of your lines.
- **Color Customization**: Use color pickers to customize line and background colors.
- **Save and Open Drawings**: Save your work in `.ps` (PostScript) format and related `.json` data for future editing.
- **Export to PNG**: Export your artwork as a PNG image for sharing or printing.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark modes. The app also supports Auto Mode, which switches themes based on the time of day (6 PM to 6 AM activates dark mode).
- **Undo and Redo**: Easily undo and redo actions using keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl + Z` and `Ctrl + Y`).
